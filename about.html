            <p> The emergence and growth of blogs in the late 1990s coincided with the advent of web publishing tools
                that facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users who did not have much experience with
                HTML or computer programming. Previously, knowledge of such technologies as HTML and File Transfer
                Protocol had been required to publish content on the Web, and early Web users therefore tended to be
                hackers and computer enthusiasts. As of the 2010s, the majority are interactive Web 2.0 websites,
                allowing visitors to leave online comments, and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them from
                other static websites.[2] In that sense, blogging can be seen as a form of social networking service.
                Indeed, bloggers not only produce content to post on their blogs but also often build social relations
                with their readers and other bloggers.[3] Blog owners or authors often moderate and filter online
                comments to remove hate speech or other offensive content. There are also high-readership blogs which do
                not allow comments. </p>
